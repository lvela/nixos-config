echo "=============="
echo ""
echo "1. Connect to TurtleBot via SSH:"
echo "   ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.70"
echo "   (Default password: turtlebot4)"
echo ""
echo "2. On the TurtleBot, start the ROS system:"
echo "   ros2 launch turtlebot4_bringup standard.launch.py"
echo ""
echo "3. Back on your system, test discovery:"
echo "   ros2 node list"
echo "   ros2 topic list"
echo ""
echo "4. Control the robot with keyboard:"
echo "   ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard"
echo ""
echo "5. Or send direct commands:"
